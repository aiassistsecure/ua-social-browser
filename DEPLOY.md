# Deploying UA Social Browser

This project has two halves that ship on different tracks:

| Half | What it is | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Workspace surface** (`artifacts/ua-social-browser`, `artifacts/api-server`) | The sidebar UI, the AI endpoints, the review queue, the ledger | Replit today; embedded in the desktop shell in production |
| **Native shell** (`desktop/ua-shell`) | A Chromium desktop browser with per-workspace session isolation, UA profiles, and the session bridge | Built and signed on your own machines |

The Replit artifact is the **development surface** for the shared UI and API. It is
not the shipped product, and it deliberately cannot post to any network — see
[Why publishing fails on the web surface](#why-publishing-fails-on-the-web-surface).

---

## Running it, in one paragraph

Run `pnpm install`, then `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` to
generate the client from the OpenAPI contract, and `pnpm run typecheck` to
confirm the tree is sound. For the development surface, start the two services —
`pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` (builds and serves the API on
`PORT`, mounted at `/api`) and `pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-social-browser run
dev` (the Vite dev server for the sidebar UI) — which is all you need for
drafting, approving, scheduling, and the ledger; publishing answers `503` there
because there is no signed-in session to post through. For the real product,
build both halves the shell hosts with `PORT=5173 BASE_PATH=/ pnpm --filter
@workspace/ua-social-browser run build` and `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server
run build`, then launch `pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-shell run start`, which
builds the Electron shell, spawns its own API server on loopback, and opens the
browser — this one needs a desktop with a display and will not run in the Replit
container. Set `AIAssIST_API_KEY` before you expect any AI feature to answer.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node 24 and pnpm (already provisioned in the Replit container)
- `AIAssIST_API_KEY` — set as a Replit Secret; it never leaves the API server
- For the native shell: a desktop OS with a display. The shell is a Chromium
  (Electron) application; it cannot run in the Replit container, which has no
  GUI. Everything in it except the browser windows themselves — the session
  bridge, the idempotency ledger, the UA/Client-Hints derivation, the privileged
  origin — is covered by `pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-shell run test`, which does
  run here.

## 2. Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AIAssIST_API_KEY` | yes | — | Credential for `api.AiAssist.net`. Server-side only. |
| `PORT` | injected | `8080` | Assigned per artifact by Replit. Never hard-code it. |
| `NEDB_DATA_DIR` | no | `<cwd>/.data/ua-social-browser` | Append-only ledger location. Point it at a persistent volume in the desktop build. |
| `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL` | no | unset | Loopback address of the native shell's publisher IPC endpoint. **Unset means publishing is disabled.** |
| `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | with the above | unset | Capability token the shell mints at startup. The shell refuses every bridge call without it, so an address on its own also means publishing is disabled. Set by the shell for the API server it starts; never commit it. |
| `UA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | in the shell | unset | When set, every `/api` request must present it in `X-UA-Api-Token` and CORS is switched off entirely. The shell mints one for the API server it starts, and reads this variable to pair with an API server you run yourself. Unset on the web surface, which holds no publishing capability. |
| `HOST` | no | `0.0.0.0` | Interface to bind. The shell sets `127.0.0.1`; Replit needs the default so its proxy can reach the artifact. |
| `UA_TENANCY_MODE` | no | `single` | `single` scopes every document to the `personal` tenant. `multi` requires an auth layer to set `res.locals.tenantId` and returns 401 without one. |
| `UA_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `30000` | How often the scheduler looks for scheduled posts that are due. `0` switches automatic dispatch off; a scheduled post then waits for someone to press Post. Ignored in multi-tenant mode — see [Scheduled dispatch](#6-scheduled-dispatch). |

Read by the native shell only (`desktop/ua-shell`):

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UA_WORKSPACE_UI_URL` | no | unset | Load the sidebar from a running dev server instead of the built bundle. Development only. |
| `UA_WORKSPACE_UI_DIR` | no | `artifacts/ua-social-browser/dist/public` | Built sidebar to serve from the shell's privileged origin. |
| `UA_API_SERVER_ENTRY` | no | `artifacts/api-server/dist/index.mjs` | API server bundle the shell spawns. |
| `UA_API_SERVER_URL` | no | unset | Use an already-running API server instead of spawning one. That server only publishes if it was itself started with `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL`. |
| `UA_SHELL_BRIDGE_PORT` | no | `0` (OS-assigned) | Fix the session bridge port when an externally-run API server needs a stable `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL`. |
| `UA_SHELL_PAIRING_FILE` | no | unset | Path to write the bridge address **and its capability token** for an API server you start yourself. Owner-readable only, and off by default. Delete the file once the API server has read it. |

The shell sets `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL`, `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, `PORT` and
`NEDB_DATA_DIR` for the API server it spawns; do not set those for it by hand.

## 3. Running the workspace surface

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen   # after any OpenAPI change
pnpm run typecheck                              # libs + all artifacts
```

Both services run as Replit workflows and restart on their own:

- `artifacts/api-server: API Server` → `http://localhost:8080`, mounted at `/api`
- `artifacts/ua-social-browser: web` → the Vite dev server, preview path `/`

Smoke test the API:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/healthz
curl -s localhost:8080/api/tenant
curl -s localhost:8080/api/browser/integrity
curl -s "localhost:8080/api/session/status?workspaceId=ws-1"
curl -s localhost:8080/api/schedule/status
```

## 4. Publishing the web surface on Replit

Use the workspace's Publish flow (Autoscale). It deploys the sidebar UI and the
API server. Set `AIAssIST_API_KEY` in the deployment's secrets — deployment
secrets are separate from development secrets. Leave `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL`
unset in that environment.

The ledger writes to local disk, so an Autoscale deployment treats its store as
ephemeral. Anything you want to keep lives on the desktop build.

## 5. The native shell

The shell lives in `desktop/ua-shell` and is a Chromium browser built on
Electron, not a source-patched Chromium fork. Electron *is* Chromium: its
`session.fromPartition('persist:ua-<workspaceId>')` is a real `BrowserContext`
with its own on-disk profile directory, and CDP `Emulation.setUserAgentOverride`
is the same mechanism a patched build would drive. A fork would add a multi-hour
build and a permanent rebase burden for capabilities already exposed here.

### Build and run

```bash
pnpm install

# the two halves the shell hosts
PORT=5173 BASE_PATH=/ pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-social-browser run build
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build

pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-shell run start   # builds, then launches Electron
```

The UI build needs `PORT` and `BASE_PATH=/`: its Vite config reads both, and the
shell serves the bundle from the root of its own origin.

`pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-shell run test` runs the shell's own suite: the
bridge contract, the idempotency ledger, UA/Client-Hints derivation, the
privileged origin's gate, and workspace-directory parsing. None of it needs a
display.

### What it provides

1. **Workspace isolation** — `src/partition.ts` and `src/workspace-contexts.ts`.
   One partition per workspace, stored under `<userData>/Partitions/`: separate
   cookies, storage, service workers, and cache. The key is
   `persist:ua-<readable>-<digest>`, where the readable part is the sanitised
   workspace id and the digest is taken from the *raw* id — sanitising alone
   would let `team/a` and `team-a` land in one cookie jar, which is a
   cross-account session leak. The main process derives the key; the workspace
   UI is told which partition it got and never reconstructs one.
2. **UA profile application** — `src/ua-metadata.ts`, applied in
   `workspace-contexts.ts`. Per-context `User-Agent` and `Accept-Language` on the
   session (so subresources match), plus `Emulation.setUserAgentOverride` with
   `userAgentMetadata` and `Emulation.setTimezoneOverride` per view (so
   `navigator.userAgentData`, `Date`, and `Intl` agree with the headers). Every
   `Sec-CH-UA*` value is derived from the UA string itself, and a non-Chromium UA
   emits no client hints at all — Safari and Firefox do not send them, and
   inventing them would be a tell.
   *Known limit:* a UA string cannot distinguish Windows 10 from 11, and Chrome
   freezes macOS at `10_15_7`. The hints report what the UA says rather than
   inventing a plausible platform version.
3. **Toolbar indicator** — `src/renderer/toolbar.ts`. The workspace name, the UA
   profile name and label ("Chrome 131 · macOS"), and the timezone stay visible
   whatever is on screen, alongside the workspace tabs.
4. **Privileged sidebar** — `src/ui-server.ts` + `src/preload/`. The workspace UI
   is served from a loopback origin that also proxies `/api` to the API server,
   so the shared UI's relative fetches work unchanged. That origin is gated by a
   random cookie set only in the privileged view's session. That one view gets a
   preload that installs `window.uaShell`; workspace surfaces, workspace tabs,
   and the hidden publish window get **no preload at all**, so page content has
   no bridge, no IPC, and no route to the API. The main process also rejects any
   bridge IPC that does not come from the privileged view, and blocks that view
   from navigating off its own origin.
5. **Publisher endpoint** — `src/session-bridge-server.ts`, bound to 127.0.0.1
   and gated by a capability token. The shell starts it *before* the API server
   and passes its address and token as `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL` and
   `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, which is the only way an API server ever gets
   either.

### The bridge is not "protected by loopback"

The human approval that gates publishing is enforced in the API server. Anything
that can call the bridge directly posts through the operator's live sessions
with no approval at all — and every other process on the machine can reach
127.0.0.1. So the shell mints a 256-bit token at startup and refuses any bridge
request that does not carry it in `X-UA-Shell-Token`, before parsing the body
and before the publisher is consulted. Because it is a custom header, a web page
cannot send it either: cross-origin requests either fail preflight (never
approved here) or arrive without it.

The token is never logged and has no default on-disk location. To pair an API
server you start yourself, launch the shell with `UA_SHELL_PAIRING_FILE=/path`;
it creates that file exclusively and owner-only (`0600`), and warns that the
file is a live capability. Delete it after use. An existing file or a symlink at
that path is refused rather than written through — anything already there could
be someone else's, and the contents can publish through your sessions.

### Nor is the API server behind it

The API server the shell starts inherits that capability, so reaching *it* is as
good as reaching the bridge. Three things close that path:

- it binds `127.0.0.1`, so nothing on the LAN can see it;
- it requires `UA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `X-UA-Api-Token` on every `/api` request,
  and the shell's UI proxy is the only holder — an inbound copy of that header
  is dropped and replaced, so a caller cannot supply its own;
- with the token configured, CORS is off, so no page can call it cross-origin.

Everything inside the shell that talks to the API carries the token: the UI
proxy and the workspace directory the toolbar and publisher read from.

If you point the shell at your own API server with `UA_API_SERVER_URL`, that
server receives the bridge capability, so gating it is **required**, not
advisory:

- run it with `HOST=127.0.0.1` and a `UA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`;
- start the shell with the same `UA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Without it the shell refuses to start and tells you why. It will not open the
privileged UI or the bridge onto an ungated API server.

### Approval is read, not asserted

`POST /api/publish` no longer believes the `approval` block in the request —
whoever sends the request writes those fields. It loads the draft from the
ledger and requires that it is there, that a person signed it off, that the
workspace and network match, and that the submitted text is *exactly* the
approved text. An approved draft id is not a licence to post something else.

### How a post goes out

`src/publisher/`. The shell opens the network's composer in a hidden window
inside that workspace's own partition and UA profile, types the approved body,
submits, and waits for the network's own confirmation. Same cookies, same
profile, same session the operator sees in the workspace tab — there is no API
token and no headless impersonation anywhere in this path.

- **Session detection** covers all twelve networks by cookie. Bluesky and
  Mastodon report "cannot tell from cookies" instead of guessing: Bluesky keeps
  its session in local storage, and a Mastodon session belongs to whichever
  instance the workspace uses.
- **Automated submission is implemented for X only.** Every other network
  answers `501` with an explicit "open the workspace tab and post there"; the
  draft stays approved. Adding a network means one adapter in
  `src/publisher/adapters.ts`.
- **Ambiguous outcomes never look like success.** If the post was submitted but
  no confirmation arrived within the deadline, the shell answers `409` and
  records the key as spent, so a retry replays that answer instead of risking a
  duplicate. The operator checks the account; the shell does not guess.
- The publish attempt is bounded at 17s so the shell — not the API server's 20s
  timeout — decides what an unfinished attempt means.

### `window.uaShell` (renderer contract)

Typed in `artifacts/ua-social-browser/src/lib/shell-bridge.ts`:

- `attachSurface(container, options)` — mounts a workspace-isolated Chromium view
- `openInWorkspaceTab(workspaceId, url)` — opens a normal tab in that workspace
- `getSessionStatus(workspaceId)` — reports whether that session is signed in

### Session bridge (HTTP contract)

The shell listens on loopback; the API server calls it. Consumed by
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/session-bridge.ts`.

Every request carries `X-UA-Shell-Token`; without it, both routes answer `401`
with a `detail` and nothing else happens.

```
GET /session/:workspaceId
  200 { authenticated: boolean, accountHandle?: string, detail?: string }

POST /publish
  body { workspaceId, draftId, platform, body, idempotencyKey }
  200      { postUrl?: string, postId?: string }
  401/403  { detail: string }   → surfaced as "session not signed in"
  4xx/5xx  { detail: string }   → surfaced as "the platform rejected the post"
```

`idempotencyKey` is derived from the draft id plus its approval timestamp, so a
retry after a network stall cannot double-post. The shell keeps the spent keys in
`<userData>/publish-ledger.json` and records only terminal results: a post that
went out, and a post whose outcome could not be confirmed. "Not signed in" is not
terminal — the operator signs in and the same approved draft goes out.

## 6. Scheduled dispatch

An approved draft with a send time goes out on its own, without the app being
open or focused. `src/lib/scheduler.ts` wakes on `UA_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS`,
finds drafts whose time has passed, and sends them down the same path a manual
press uses — same approval check, same idempotency key, same bridge.

Three properties matter more than the schedule itself:

- **The scheduler never writes the browser state document.** The app owns that
  document; two writers would clobber each other. Outcomes go to a separate
  dispatch log, and the app folds them back into the drafts it holds. That is
  how a post that went out while the app was closed still reads as posted when
  it opens a month later.
- **One attempt per instruction.** A failure is not retried in a loop; the
  reason is recorded and a person decides. Moving a post to a new time is a new
  instruction and earns one more attempt.
- **It is off in multi-tenant mode.** With no authenticated tenant, the
  scheduler has nobody to act for, so scheduled posts wait for a human press.
  `GET /api/schedule/status` says so in `detail` rather than failing quietly.

```
GET  /api/schedule/status       { active, bridgeConfigured, intervalMs, detail }
GET  /api/schedule/dispatches   recent attempts for this tenant (a tail, for looking)
POST /api/schedule/outcomes     { keys: string[] } → outcomes for those exact keys
```

Reconciliation asks by key, not by reading a recent feed — a client that has
been away for a month asks about the handful of drafts it left behind and gets
every one of their outcomes. The tail endpoint is for humans inspecting what
happened.

Automatic dispatch needs the bridge, so on the web surface `active` is `false`
and `bridgeConfigured` is `false`. Nothing is silently queued.

## 7. Why publishing fails on the web surface

Posts leave through **your own signed-in browser session**, never through a
server-held token. With no shell attached, `POST /api/publish` answers `503` and
the draft is marked `failed` with the reason attached. That is the intended
behaviour: a silent success would be a lie about whether something reached an
audience.

## 8. Networks

X is the primary network. Also configured: Instagram, Facebook, Threads,
LinkedIn, Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr. Each
carries its own character limit, media rules, thread support, and feed/compose
URLs in `artifacts/ua-social-browser/src/lib/platforms.ts`. Adding a network
means adding an entry there and to the `platform` enum in
`lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`, then re-running codegen.

Live network views render only inside the native shell. X, Instagram, and the
rest send frame-blocking headers, so the web surface shows an explicit "runs in
the desktop shell" state and an open-in-tab link rather than a fake feed.

## 9. Data and integrity

State is a single append-only `nedb-engine` ledger, scoped by tenant id.
`GET /api/browser/integrity` returns `verified`, `sequence`, and `head`;
`GET /api/browser/export` downloads the full state with its integrity record.
Back up `NEDB_DATA_DIR` — that directory is the product's memory.

`nedb-engine` loads a prebuilt `.node` binding relative to its own directory, so
it is marked external in `artifacts/api-server/build.mjs`. Bundling it produces
`Cannot find module 'nedb-engine-linux-x64-gnu'` at startup.

## 10. Release checklist

- [ ] `pnpm run typecheck` clean
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @workspace/ua-shell run test` green
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test` green — the scheduled
      dispatch suite, which needs no display either
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` re-run after any spec edit
- [ ] `AIAssIST_API_KEY` present in the target environment
- [ ] `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL` / `UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_TOKEN` unset on the web
      surface; on the desktop build, confirmed to be set by the shell rather
      than by hand, and no pairing file left behind
- [ ] Shell launched once per release: two workspaces signed into the same
      network stay signed in as different accounts, and the toolbar names the
      right workspace and UA profile in each
- [ ] Desktop build only: `curl` the API server's port directly and confirm it
      answers `401`, and that it is not reachable from another machine
- [ ] Approve → post round-trip verified against one real account per network
- [ ] Approval revocation verified: editing an approved draft clears the sign-off
- [ ] `NEDB_DATA_DIR` backed up
