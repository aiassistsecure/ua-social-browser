/**
 * Scheduled dispatch.
 *
 * A time attached to an approved draft is a promise that the post will go out
 * then. This loop keeps it: every tick it looks for drafts that are due and
 * pushes them through the same door the Post button uses.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - It never posts without an approval attached. Editing a draft clears the
 *   approval, so an edited draft simply stops being eligible.
 * - It never retries on its own. One automatic attempt per instruction — this
 *   approval, for this send time — after which the draft is `failed` with the
 *   reason on it and a person decides. Moving it to a new time is a new
 *   instruction and earns one more attempt; the idempotency key is what stops
 *   any of that posting the same thing twice.
 * - It never writes into the browser state document. The browser owns that
 *   document; the scheduler reports through the dispatch log instead, so the
 *   two cannot clobber each other's writes.
