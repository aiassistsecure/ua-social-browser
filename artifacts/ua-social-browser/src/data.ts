/**
 * The state a fresh install boots with, and what "Reset to defaults" returns to.
 *
 * It is deliberately empty of anything that looks like a tenant. An earlier
 * version shipped a fictional operator, three fictional accounts, and sample
 * drafts here so the UI had something to show. That broke the project's own
 * rule against mock data in a way that reached a real audience: an operator
 * approved one of the sample drafts while the sample operator name was still
 * in Settings, published it from their real account, and the ledger recorded
 * the sign-off under a person who does not exist. Approvals are snapshots of
 * who signed at the time, so no later rename could correct it — the only fix
 * was for the fiction never to have been there.
 *
 * UA profiles stay. They are declared device configurations (real browser
 * strings, visible in the toolbar), not identities, and a workspace needs one
 * to exist before it can be created.
