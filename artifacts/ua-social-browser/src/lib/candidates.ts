/**
 * The composer's candidate pool.
 *
 * The composer is a loop: generate options, judge them, and each one you judge
 * leaves. So the list is a working pool rather than the result of one request —
 * a second generation adds to it instead of replacing it, and acting on a card
 * removes that card.
 *
 * Two things follow from that, and both are the reason this is a module with
 * tests rather than a few lines inline:
 *
 *  - **A candidate needs a stable id.** Review state used to be keyed by array
 *    index. That is harmless while the array only ever grows from zero, and
 *    actively dangerous the moment cards can be removed: drop option 2 and
 *    option 3's "I read this and take responsibility for it" slides onto
 *    option 4, so text nobody read reaches drafts under someone's sign-off.
 *  - **The label must not renumber.** An ordinal is assigned when a candidate
 *    arrives and never changes, so a card you are reading keeps its number
 *    while the ones around it disappear — and the numbers climbing past the
 *    batch size is an honest picture of how many options you have been through.
