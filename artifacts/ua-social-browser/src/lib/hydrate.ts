/**
 * Bringing a stored document up to the shape this build expects.
 *
 * The ledger holds documents written by every version that came before. A
 * field added to `BrowserState` today does not appear in a draft saved last
 * week, and TypeScript cannot help: the type says `media: DraftMedia[]`, the
 * JSON on disk says nothing at all, and the first `draft.media.length` throws.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical — it is exactly how attachments broke the review
 * queue. Drafts written before media existed came back with `media` undefined,
 * `drafts.tsx` read `.length` on it, and the whole section died inside its
 * error boundary. The fix belongs here, at the one place a stored document
 * enters the app, rather than as a defensive read at each of the thirteen
 * places that touch the field.
 *
 * **This never rewrites anything on disk.** It fills gaps in the copy held in
 * memory. The ledger keeps every byte it already had; the next ordinary save
 * happens to include the filled-in defaults, which are additive.
 *
 * The rule for anyone adding a field to a persisted type: add it here in the
 * same commit, with a test for a document that predates it.
