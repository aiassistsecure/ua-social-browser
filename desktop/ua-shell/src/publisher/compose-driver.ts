/**
 * A shared composer driver.
 *
 * Every text network works the same way from the outside: wait for a composer,
 * put the approved text in it, submit once, and then decide whether the post
 * actually went out. Only the selectors differ. Writing that flow once means
 * the part that matters — deciding what counts as "sent" — is written once and
 * tested once, instead of eleven times with eleven different bugs.
 *
 * The rule the flow exists to enforce: **an outcome is only `published` when
 * the network said so.** Anything else is a rejection or, when the post may
 * have gone out but nothing confirmed it, an unconfirmed result that is never
 * retried automatically. A driver that guessed would eventually double-post or
 * claim an audience that never saw anything.
 *
 * Selectors belong to other people's products and will drift. When one does,
 * the flow reports which step failed rather than falling through to a cheerful
 * result — repair the config, not the reasoning.
