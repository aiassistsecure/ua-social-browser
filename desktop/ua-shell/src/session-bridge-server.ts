/**
 * The loopback publisher endpoint.
 *
 * This is the server half of the contract consumed by
 * `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/session-bridge.ts` and documented in
 * DEPLOY.md section 5:
 *
 *   GET  /session/:workspaceId  200 { authenticated, accountHandle?, detail? }
 *   POST /publish               200 { postUrl?, postId? }
 *                               401 { detail }  -> "session not signed in"
 *                               4xx/5xx { detail } -> "the platform rejected it"
 *
 * It binds to 127.0.0.1 only. The API server is handed its address through
 * UA_SESSION_BRIDGE_URL; with no address, the API server reports publishing as
 * unavailable rather than pretending to post.
 *
 * ## Why loopback is not enough
 *
 * This endpoint reaches the operator's own signed-in sessions, and the human
 * approval that gates publishing is enforced in the API server — a caller that
 * could reach the bridge directly would be posting with no approval at all.
 * Every other local process, and every browser page the operator visits, can
 * also talk to 127.0.0.1. So the bridge requires a capability token that the
 * shell generates at startup and gives only to the API server it trusts;
 * requests without it are refused before the publisher is ever consulted.
 *
 * The token travels in a custom header, which also means a browser cannot send
 * it: any cross-origin attempt is either blocked by CORS preflight (which this
 * server never approves) or arrives without the header and is refused.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Electron imports so the contract can be tested with a
 * stub publisher under plain Node.
